This test is running on valet.

Facebook requires all callback to be on https connection, so you have to set valet to use secure routing ("https") in order to run this test.

Only reviewed app on facebook can be accessed by general users on facebook. So, the list of testing users below are created in order to run this test.

Users:
zubbsolaria_hmpnwzd_user@tfbnw.net
zubbsolaria_okpngex_test@tfbnw.net
open_dqllhdb_user@tfbnw.net

Password: 123567

You can login facebook with the list of users above and the same password every account. So, you can run this php laravel test.

THANK YOU!!!! :D


P.S. You may find the database information in '.env' file.
